## Summary
In conclusion, the Ensemble Classifier and the Random Forest Classifier models greatly outperformed the other models in prediciton accuracy. 

For this problem space (loan risk assessment) we would want a system that erred on the side of caution, so that we would be more likely to NOT give a loan to someone who might erroneously classified as qualified. That means we might weigh the sensitivity ("recall") score higher than the precision value in determining which model to use. 

**Recommendation:** The Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier is the clear winner out of these models, with a high accuracy, precision, and sensitivity value. The previous note about weighing recall more heavily in our considerations does not actually need to be factored into this decision, as the model is superior in all noted metrics.
